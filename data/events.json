In this talk we will try to cover all aspects of laziness in Kotlin: starting from lazy initialization of properties using delegates, lazy collections, sequences and, finally, laziness with coroutines.

And if you're thinking \"Wait, what's Kotlin got to do with my build scripts? Ain't that just a JSON-ish Gradle specific text file?\", then don't worry. Marcin will explain that in fact no, the build script is just code (spoiler: not Java\u2122\ufe0f Programming Language code, but close) and how Gradle Kotlin DSL makes it better.</p>\n<p>He'll also take a pretty detailed look at how Gradle Kotlin DSL works for Android projects. Can you use it for your app's build script right now? Does it support the extra features (and complexity) that the Android Gradle plugin adds into the mix?</p>\n<p>If you're more (or also) interested in plugin development, writing them in Kotlin is not so new, but he'll quickly show how to do it anyway because it's great and you should try it!</p>"}, {"lang": "en", "startDate": "2018-10-26", "endDate": "2018-10-26", "location": "London, UK", "speaker": "Jorge Ortiz Fuentes", "title": "droidcon London 2018", "subject": "Workshop: Let's Migrate to Gradle Kotlin DSL", "url": "https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10301-droidcon-london-2018#program", "content": {"video": "https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12187-workshop-let-s-migrate-to-gradle-kotlin-dsl"}, "description": "<p>Gradle is an awesome and very powerful build tool. It is key to tune your build and even more relevant to achieve the promised karma of continuous integration. However, one of its biggest \"shortcomings\" is that in order to extract any drop of power juice, you need to know and use Groovy. Nothing against Groovy, but it is just another language and, very likely, one that you don't use very often. But worry no more! Now you can use the same language that you enjoy and use it when you write the code of your apps: Kotlin. During this workshop Jorge will start with a walk through some of the most relevant features of gradle. Then you will learn how to transform the gradle configuration of a project to use Kotlin DSL. You will finish by extending that configuration with a new functionality taking advantage of writing it in Kotlin.
