Bugs that exist in Java such as NullPointerExceptions are not possible in Kotlin.

Android applications have begun increasingly reactive using architectures like MVVM, MVI, Redux, etc., The reactive nature of these applications are due to the underlying architecture rather than the UI framework itself. This has resulted in some big wins like testability and strong separation of concerns while trading-off attributes like time-to-market and quickly on-boarding new developers to an existing project.</p>\n<p>The API surface of the Android UI framework has been the same for the past decade. This was largely because of the limitations imposed by old tooling and the programming language. With Kotlin bringing in DSLs, functional programming and compiler plugin capabilities - the members of the Android UI Toolkit team have rolled up their sleeves and are taking a new direction. The new UI toolkit is backed by principles and techniques like - one-way data flow, function composition, declarative programming, optimistic concurrency control, isolation of side-effects, etc.,</p>\n<p>This shift in API design also demands a shift in thinking about the app architecture and building UIs. In this talk, we\u2019ll see how Jetpack Compose is radically different from the existing Android UI framework and how it adopts several ideas and programming patterns from web frameworks like React, MobX, and Vue.js.

The following topics will be discussed during the session:\n- Gotchas when using Kotlin with Spring Boot\n- Imperative and declarative approaches\n- Servlet-stack web applications\n- Reactive-stack web applications to run on non-blocking servers\n- Going serverless\n- Alternative frameworks</p>"}, {"lang": "en", "startDate": "2019-05-16", "endDate": "2019-05-16", "location": "Cambridge, MA", "speaker": "Russell Wolf", "title": "Kotlin Office Hours", "subject": "A Year of Multiplatform Library Development", "url": "https://www.meetup.com/kotlin-office-hours/events/261263188/", "description": "<p>The Kotlin Multiplatform world has grown a lot in the last year.

Or spend hours chasing down NullPointerExceptions in your Java app? Enter Kotlin, JetBrains' new(ish) free, open-source programming language that targets the JVM. This means you can use it everywhere you use Java, but with a modern, succinct syntax. For native Android developers, Kotlin is not only available, but it's now considered a first-class language. You're able to write an app completely with Kotlin, or switch over entire components, or even just change your models to Kotlin's data classes (which removes a TON of boilerplate code.) Oh, and for anyone using Java elsewhere, you can add in Kotlin code to your existing application. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, meaning all your existing code/libraries/tests will work with any Kotlin code you write. Doing JavaScript development? Kotlin can be transpiled into ES5, and there are even libraries available to use React or Angular with Kotlin. C# dev working on any kind of Java project? You'll feel much more at home with Kotlin, given features like nullable types, properties (rather than getters/setters), and extension methods.

This means you can use it everywhere you use Java, but with a modern, succinct syntax. For native Android developers, Kotlin is not only available, but it's now considered a first-class language. You're able to write an app completely with Kotlin, or switch over entire components, or even just change your models to Kotlin's data classes (which removes a TON of boilerplate code.) Oh, and for anyone using Java elsewhere, you can add in Kotlin code to your existing application. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, meaning all your existing code/libraries/tests will work with any Kotlin code you write. Doing JavaScript development? Kotlin can be transpiled into ES5, and there are even libraries available to use React or Angular with Kotlin. C# dev working on any kind of Java project?

The world of languages on the JVM has seen alternatives to Java come and go. Kotlin is probably the most popular one at this moment. Although Java is still one of the most commonly used programming languages, Kotlin seems to keep growing very fast. Where Java is known for its verbosity, Kotlin aims at making programming easier. On the other hand, Kotlin is a mix of paradigms and forces you to learn yet another language. Moreover, with all the new features that are rapidly introduced in Java, is Kotlin actually needed? So what are the aspects where they differ from each other? In which situations should we choose the one or the other? Should we migrate to Kotlin or is Java good enough? As Kotlin claims full interoperability with Java, should we even choose? In this talk we will fire up the battle between Kotlin and Java. In this battle one of us will root for Java while the other cheers for Kotlin. Who wins? That is totally up to you. The audience will be judge and jury.

I\u2019ll discuss why this is important to us as developers, integration details, and how Moshi implemented this feature!</p>"}, {"lang": "ru", "startDate": "2019-03-02", "endDate": "2019-03-02", "location": "Taganrog, Russia", "speaker": "Alexey Shafranov", "title": "Taganrog Kotlin User Group", "subject": "\u0418\u0441\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 Kotlin \u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438", "url": "https://vk.com/wall-177966710_6"}, {"lang": "ru", "startDate": "2019-03-02", "endDate": "2019-03-02", "location": "Taganrog, Russia", "speaker": "Andrey Tereshchenko", "title": "Taganrog Kotlin User Group", "subject": "\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b. \u0413\u0438\u0431\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 Kotlin", "url": "https://vk.com/wall-177966710_6"}, {"lang": "ru", "startDate": "2019-03-02", "endDate": "2019-03-02", "location": "Taganrog, Russia", "speaker": "Victor Petrenko", "title": "Taganrog Kotlin User Group", "subject": "Kotlin vs Swift", "url": "https://vk.com/wall-177966710_6"}, {"lang": "ru", "startDate": "2019-03-02", "endDate": "2019-03-02", "location": "Taganrog, Russia", "speaker": "Denis Alexandrov", "title": "Taganrog Kotlin User Group", "subject": "\u0414\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u043e\u0442 Kotlin - \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440", "url": "https://vk.com/wall-177966710_6"}, {"lang": "ru", "startDate": "2019-03-02", "endDate": "2019-03-02", "location": "Samara, Russia", "speaker": "Andrey Antipov", "title": "Samara Kotlin User Groups", "subject": "\u0422\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 (\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440) \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 Kotlin", "url": "https://samara-it-community.timepad.ru/event/897399/", "description": "<p>\u041d\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0421 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u044f \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f Kotlin</p>"}, {"lang": "en", "startDate": "2019-02-02", "endDate": "2019-02-02", "location": "Bangladesh, India", "speaker": "S M Mohi-Us Sunnat", "title": "Bangladesh Kotlin User Group", "subject": "A Day with Kotlin for DIU Students", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/2269176219995187/", "description": "<p>This is the first meetup arranged by Bangladesh Kotlin User Group for the developers of Bangladesh.

We\u2019ll look at data classes, top level and first class functions, inlining, null safety and more, including the design decisions behind some of the language choices. We\u2019ll see how you can build DSLs, with examples from Android and HTML, and look at how we can build multi-platform projects.

We will try to understand its pros and cons and where this approach could be used. We will also compare this approach with the alternatives. The most interesting about this talk is that we will have lots of practice.

Any networking or database calls require background threads to avoid blocking the UI, which could create ANR (Application Not Responding) bugs.</p>\n<p>The Android framework provides AsyncTasks, which can be unwieldy. Some app developers use 3rd party libraries like RxJava to handle threading, which can involve a steep learning curve.</p>\n<p>Coroutines provide a few advantages over these, but most importantly coroutines make asynchronous code read like synchronous code. With the release of Kotlin v1.3, coroutines are now stable.

We'll see how this looks and discuss why it should be like this and not the other way around.</p>\n<p>Kotlin/Native technology allows you to compile Kotlin into native code while also giving you an option to interact seamlessly with native platform (iOS, for example).

Some people will probably just jump straight to JUnit as a testing framework, but did you know you that Spek offers an alternative approach with a domain specific language (DSL) for tests? Your choice of tools doesn't stop here. You have alternative assertion libraries, mocking frameworks and more that are different from what you may be used to in Java. The builder pattern is also even simpler in Kotlin, which make creating test data builders work like a charm. We will look at these topics and more!
