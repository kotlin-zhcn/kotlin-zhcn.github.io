                teaches you the right way to code in Kotlin. In this insight-rich book,
                you'll master the Kotlin language while exploring coding techniques that will make you a better developer
                no matter what language you use. Kotlin natively supports a functional style of programming,
                so seasoned author Pierre-Yves Saumont begins by reviewing the FP principles of immutability,
                referential transparency, and the separation between functions and effects.
                Then, you'll move deeper into using Kotlin in the real world, as you learn to handle errors and data
                properly,
                encapsulate shared state mutations, and work with laziness. This book will change the way you code — and
                give you back some of the joy you had when you first started.</p>

                by Mehmet Ali SICAK was created to introduce Kotlin to programmers.
                This book is the first and currently only Kotlin book in Turkish.
                Published on the 17 July 2017, Kotlin covers a broad spectrum of topics from Kotlin and Innovations, Kotlin
                and Java,
                Kotlin and Android, what can be done with Kotlin, and working with null data in Kotlin. With detailed
                insight into using
                variables and data types, range concept, arrays, collections, object-based programming, interfaces, generic,
                abstract, inheritance, and override rules
                with Kotlin, with a lot of sample applications.
                This book provides beginners and intermediate programmers with information on the fundamental
                working principles of the Kotlin language, for a substantial foundation to build on when developing
                applications
                with Android. This book is in Turkish.</p>

                to programming — and then takes you through Kotlin fundamentals.
                But, if you’re familiar with Kotlin, you’ll advance into more intermediate
                and nuanced features of the language, such as functional programming,
                conventions and operator overloading, and coroutines. Whatever your familiarity with the language,
                this book will teach you to organize and customize your code in Kotlin to create
                clean and modern apps in Kotlin.</p>

                As the title suggests, "Kotlin Kompakt" is not an all-encompassing work on Kotlin. Rather,
                its focus is on providing the necessary foundations and Kotlin's best features,
                which make it such a remarkable programming language.</p>

                è un linguaggio di programmazione open source ideato per interfacciarsi perfettamente con Java, ma anche JavaScript, attraverso una sintassi più concisa e chiara. A partire dal 2017 l'interesse verso Kotlin è cresciuto costantemente a seguito della decisione di Google di supportarlo come linguaggio principale per lo sviluppo di applicazioni Android, proprio come alternativa a Java.
                Questo manuale ne insegna i fondamenti privilegiando la pratica alla teoria. Dopo l'esplorazione dell'ambiente di sviluppo, si affronta la sintassi di base e i "mattoni" del linguaggio, con particolare attenzione alle funzioni. Quindi viene affrontata la programmazione a oggetti e quella funzionale, prima di concludere esplorando alcuni degli aspetti più avanzati, come l'interoperabilità con Java, i contract e le coroutine.
                Una lettura adatta sia a chi desidera conoscere un nuovo e moderno linguaggio, sia agli sviluppatori mobile che vogliono iniziare a sfruttare Kotlin per creare app Android.</p>

                Android Applications: a Tic-Tac-Toe application, a location- based alarm and a To-Do list
                application. The book begins by giving you a strong grasp of the Kotlin language and its
                APIs as a preliminary to building stunning applications for Android. You'll learn to set up
                an environment and as you progress through the chapters and the building of the different
                applications, the difficulty level will steadily grow. The book also introduces you
                to the Android Studio IDE, which plays an integral role in Android Development. I
                t covers Kotlin's basic programming concepts such as functions, lambdas, properties,
                object-oriented code, safety aspects and type parameterization, testing, and concurrency,
                and helps you write Kotlin code to production. Finally, you'll be taken through the process
                of releasing your app on the Google Play Store. You will also be introduced to other app
                distribution channels such as Amazon App Store.</p>

                The book starts by analyzing various Kotlin specifcations to identify those that have a potentially
                adverse effect on performance. Then, we move on to monitor techniques that
                enable us to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize performance metrics.
                Next, we look at techniques that help to us achieve high performance: memory optimization,
                concurrency, multi threading, scaling, and caching. We also look at fault tolerance
                solutions and the importance of logging. We'll also cover best practices of Kotlin
                programming that will help you to improve the quality of your code base.
                By the end of the book, you will have gained some insight into various techniques and
                solutions that will help to create high-performance applications in the Kotlin environment.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/178899664X">Learning Concurrency in Kotlin</a>
                This book describes new approaches to concurrency and creates
                unique challenges for the design and implementation of concurrent code.
                'Learning Concurrency in Kotlin' addresses the challenges of
                concurrent implementation with real-life examples and exercises that
                take advantage of Kotlin’s primitives. Beginning with an introduction to
                Kotlin’s coroutines, you will learn how to write concurrent code and understand
                the fundamental concepts needed to write multithreaded software in Kotlin.
                You’ll explore how to communicate between and synchronize your threads and
                coroutines to write asynchronous applications that are collaborative.
                You’ll also learn how to handle errors and exceptions, as well as how to
                leverage multi-core processing. In addition to this, you’ll delve into how
                coroutines work internally, allowing you to see the bigger picture.
                Through the book, you’ll build an Android application – an RSS reader – designed
                and implemented according to the different topics covered in the book.</p>
